# Task 4
## Using R example datasets
**Describe briefly the content of the CO2 dataset using the help function**
```{r}
#load the data
data("CO2")
?CO2
```
The experiment is analyzing the cold tolerance of the grass species *Echinochola cruss-galli* by measuring the CO2 response curve for photosynthesis. The data contain the CO2 uptake at several levels of CO2 concentration in the chilled and non-chilled plants.

**What is the average and median CO2 uptake of the plants from Quebec and Missisipi?**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
data(CO2)
#select the plant originated from quebec only
Quebec <-filter(CO2, Type=="Quebec")
summary(Quebec)
#select the plant originated from Mississippi only
Mississippi<-filter(CO2, Type=="Mississippi")
summary(Mississippi)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#generate the table
data <-data_frame(
  Plant_Origin = c("Quebec", "Mississippi"),
  Mean = c(33.54, 20.88),
  Median = c(37.15, 19.30))
knitr::kable(data, caption = "CO2 uptake based on plant origin")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
