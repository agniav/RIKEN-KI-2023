The course is jointly organized by RIKEN Japan and Karolinska Institutet Sweden. In this course, students were grouped in a 5-6 persons and mentored directly with the researchers from RIKEN or Karolinska Institutet.
In this course, I was mentored by Dr. Carsten Daub and got access to his clinical data. During the course, I learned the basic visualization of RNA-seq data and analyze the diffentially expressed genes using DESeq2.
This repository is a documentation of assignments and presentation during the course.
